# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component

This is my solution to the **QR Code Component** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).  
It’s one of my first projects, and it helped me practice HTML and CSS basics.

## 📚 What I Learned

Most of the time, I didn’t understand why my CSS (color, font, padding, flexbox, etc.) wasn’t showing.  
Then I realized I had forgotten to link the CSS file in my HTML 😅.  
It was such a small mistake that caused a big problem — I laughed at myself, but that’s how we learn!

Another thing I learned is how to pick values for padding, margin, and font-size using **px**, **vw**, **rem**, and **em**.  
I’m still a bit confused about which units are best for making layouts adapt to different screen sizes, but I’m improving.

## 🔮 Continued Development

- Get more comfortable choosing between `px`, `vw`, `rem`, and `em`.  
- Practice more responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid.  
- Write cleaner, more semantic HTML structure.
